# Phase 1: Frontend Restoration Plan

This document outlines the plan to restore the frontend functionality of the application to its previous working state before the restructuring.

## Overview

The application was restructured from a "PR Analysis Tool" focused on GitHub PR scoring to a more generalized "Content Scoring System" with modular architecture. This restructuring removed critical frontend components needed for GitHub API integration, comment rendering, and UI management. Phase 1 focuses on restoring these components while maintaining compatibility with the new modular system.

## Key Objectives

1. Restore GitHub API integration
2. Restore comment processing and rendering
3. Restore UI components and state management
4. Integrate with current modular architecture
5. Test and validate functionality

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Restore Critical GitHub API Integration Components

- **1.1 Recreate GitHub API Service**
  - Implement `github-api-service.ts` to handle GitHub API requests
  - Add caching mechanism for API responses
  - Implement error handling for API requests
  - Restore authentication logic using GitHub tokens

- **1.2 Restore URL Parsing**
  - Implement proper GitHub URL parsing for PRs and Issues
  - Handle various GitHub URL formats
  - Extract owner, repo, number, and type information

- **1.3 Implement Data Fetching**
  - Fetch PR and Issue details
  - Fetch PR and Issue comments
  - Handle linked PRs and Issues

### 2. Restore Comment Processing & Rendering

- **2.1 Restore Comment Components**
  - Recreate `comment-component.ts` for rendering GitHub comments
  - Implement markdown rendering for comment content
  - Add proper styling and layout for comments

- **2.2 Implement Comment Grouping**
  - Restore comment grouping logic for consecutive comments
  - Handle different comment types (PR, Issue, Review)
  - Support proper chronological ordering of comments

- **2.3 Restore Score Calculation**
  - Reimplement comment score calculation
  - Support different scoring algorithms (original, log-adjusted, exponential)
  - Display scores alongside comments

### 3. Restore UI Components & State Management

- **3.1 Recreate UI State Manager**
  - Implement loading states and transitions
  - Manage content visibility
  - Handle error states

- **3.2 Restore Score Summary**
  - Recreate score summary component
  - Show contributor statistics and metrics
  - Implement sorting and filtering of scores

- **3.3 Add Notifications**
  - Implement notification system for content updates
  - Add error notifications
  - Show loading indicators

### 4. Integrate with Current Modular Architecture

- **4.1 Connect with Module Chain**
  - Ensure restored components work with the module chain system
  - Maintain compatibility with the existing scoring pipeline
  - Update analyzer.ts to use the restored GitHub API service

- **4.2 Update Event System**
  - Align with the new event-driven architecture
  - Use cloud events for consistency
  - Maintain backward compatibility

### 5. Testing & Validation

- **5.1 Test GitHub Integration**
  - Verify API calls with different tokens
  - Test error handling and fallbacks
  - Validate with various GitHub repositories

- **5.2 Test Rendering**
  - Verify correct comment rendering
  - Test with various comment types and formats
  - Ensure proper markdown rendering

- **5.3 Test Scoring**
  - Validate score calculations
  - Test with different comment patterns
  - Verify contributor summaries

## Dependencies

- Current modular architecture components
- Marked.js for markdown rendering
- GitHub API

## Success Criteria

- User can enter a GitHub PR or Issue URL
- Application correctly fetches and displays all comments
- Comments are properly grouped and displayed in chronological order
- Scores are calculated and displayed correctly
- Contributor summary shows accurate statistics
- The application handles errors gracefully
