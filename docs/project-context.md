# Project Context

## Overview

This project analyzes GitHub comment scores using different scoring algorithms to evaluate conversation quality in PR #31 of the command-ask repository. The goal is to compare different scoring methods and visualize how they handle various types of comments.

## Background

This analysis originated from a PR discussion about scoring GitHub comments and the need to evaluate different scoring algorithms. The conversation centered around PR #31 in the ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-ask repository, which involved significant discussion about LLM tool usage and architecture decisions.

## Scoring Algorithms

Three distinct scoring algorithms were implemented to evaluate comment quality:

1. **Original Score**
   ```
   score = wordCount^0.85
   ```
   A basic power-law relationship that rewards longer comments but with diminishing returns.

2. **Log-Adjusted Score**
   ```
   score = wordCount^0.85 * (1/log2(wordCount + 2))
   ```
   Introduces a logarithmic penalty for very long comments to better balance conciseness.

3. **Exponential-Adjusted Score**
   ```
   score = wordCount^0.85 * exp(-wordCount/100)
   ```
   Adds an exponential decay factor to more aggressively penalize excessive length.

## Data Sources

The analysis uses three main data sources stored in the `data/` directory:

- `pr_details.json` - Core PR information
- `pr_comments.json` - Comment data from the PR
- `issue_comments.json` - Related issue comments

## Visualizations

Multiple iterations of visualization tools were developed:

1. `src/score-visualization.html` - Initial version
2. `src/score-comparison.html` - First comparison view
3. `src/score-comparison-v2.html` - Enhanced comparison
4. `src/comment-scores.html` - Final version with:
   - Proper markdown rendering
   - Blockquote support
   - Individual comment analysis
   - User contribution totals
   - Interactive score comparisons

## Key Features

The final visualization (`comment-scores.html`) includes:

- GitHub-style markdown rendering
- Proper handling of:
  - Code blocks
  - Blockquotes
  - Links
  - Lists
  - Horizontal rules
- Word counting that:
  - Excludes code blocks
  - Includes blockquote text
  - Handles markdown formatting
- Per-comment metrics
- User-based statistics
- Comparative scoring analysis

## Technical Details

### Word Count Implementation

The word counting algorithm carefully handles various markdown elements:
```javascript
const countWords = (text) => {
    // Remove code blocks
    let cleanText = text.replace(/`[^`]*`/g, '');
    // Keep link text, remove URLs
    cleanText = cleanText.replace(/\[([^\]]+)\]\([^)]+\)/g, '$1');
    // Remove horizontal rules
    cleanText = cleanText.replace(/^-{3,}$/gm, '');
    // Keep blockquote text, remove markers
    cleanText = cleanText.replace(/^>\s*/gm, '');
    return cleanText.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 0).length;
};
```

### Styling

The visualization uses modern CSS features for a clean, GitHub-like appearance:
- System font stack
- Subtle shadows
- Responsive layout
- Proper spacing and hierarchy
- Color-coded scores (blue/green/red)

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Metrics**
   - Comment frequency analysis
   - Response time measurements
   - Thread depth impact

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Time-based view
   - Conversation flow diagram
   - Interactive adjustments of scoring parameters

3. **Analysis Features**
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Code snippet detection
   - Link relevance scoring

## Note for Future LLMs

When working with this project:

1. Pay attention to the word counting implementation, which carefully handles markdown elements while preserving semantic content.
2. The scoring algorithms are designed to balance between encouraging thorough responses and maintaining conciseness.
3. The visualization is built to be self-contained (no external dependencies except marked.js) for easy deployment and sharing.
4. The project structure separates concerns between data, visualization, and documentation.
